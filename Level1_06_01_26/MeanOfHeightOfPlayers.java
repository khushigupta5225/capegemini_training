//Problem 6

//Create a program to find the mean height of players present in a football team.
//        Hint =>
//The formula to calculate the mean is: mean = sum of all elements / number of elements
//Create a double array named heights of size 11 and get input values from the user.
//Find the sum of all the elements present in the array.
//Divide the sum by 11 to find the mean height and print the mean height of the football team
